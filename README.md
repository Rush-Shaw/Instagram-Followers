# Instagram-Followers
A python program that parses json files to tell if a person you follow on instagram follows you back or not

--- How to use the program ---

1) Go to Instagram for Web (Insta on your laptop) and head over to your profile. Next you want to select the three lines ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69100536/236705938-38d48445-d629-4560-9898-3fc536748f7f.png) and click on the "Your activity" button. This will lead you to a page with all the activities you have performed over the years on instagram.

2) Now you will want to click on "Download your information," and then input the email you want the data to be sent to. Remember to download the data as **JSON** or else the program will not function as intended.

3) It'll take about 4 hours or longer for your data to be available for download and once it's ready, you will be able to download a zipped file. You will then go to the folder titled **followers and following** and extract out the two files; **followers_1.json** and **following.json**. These will be the files needed to get your info. 

4) Create a REPL Python file like so:

then proceed to dropping the two previously stated files into the file hub.

5) Finally, copy the code from the python file here and paste it into **main.py**. This should gurantee that everything runs smoothly. Once you press **run**, a .txt file will appear in the file hub from where you will be able to see and download all the people that haven't followed you back.
